## A Computer Architecture Project in Python

### Introduction
A simple Computer Architecture  project as part of my Computer Science course. This project is a Python-based simulator of a unique Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It is designed to interpret and execute binary instructions, handle basic arithmetic operations, and maintain a history of calculations. The calculator serves as a practical tool for understanding fundamental concepts in computer architecture and binary computation.

### Features and Objectives
The project aims to demonstrate the following key features and objectives:

- **Instruction Set Architecture Simulation**: Simulating a custom ISA for executing arithmetic operations.
- **Binary Data Handling**: Processing binary instructions into executable operations.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Implementing basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Register Management**: Efficient use of registers for storing data and history of calculations.
- **Educational Tool**: Serving as a hands-on experience for understanding CPU operations and binary data processing.

### Technologies and Concepts Used
- **Python 3**: Utilized for its efficiency and versatility in handling complex data structures.
- **Binary Arithmetic**: Core concept for interpreting and executing instructions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Applied to create a structured and modular simulator.
- **Computer Architecture Principles**: Fundamental concepts in ISA design and CPU operation.

### How to Use
1. **Setting Up**:
   - Clone this repository to your machine.
   - Run the main Python script to initiate the simulator.

2. **Using the Simulator**:
   - Input 32-bit binary instruction strings.
   - Instructions consist of opcodes, source registers, store values, and function codes.

3. **Example Operations**:
   - Add numbers in registers 1 and 2: `00000000001000100000000000100000`
   - Retrieve the last calculation: `10000100000000000000000000000000`

Experiment with different binary instructions to explore the functionality of the USCC.
